Adaptive Tech Skill Accelerator

Overview

Adaptive Tech Skill Accelerator is an AI-powered learning platform that evaluates a learner’s real coding ability through live coding diagnostics instead of MCQs. It analyzes problem-solving approach, debugging behavior, code structure, and optimization patterns to identify skill gaps and generate a personalized, time-bound learning roadmap.

Problem Statement

Traditional learning platforms rely on static quizzes and generic courses, failing to accurately measure real-world coding skills or adapt to individual learning speeds, leading to inefficient preparation and skill mismatch.

Solution

The platform conducts a live coding diagnostic session to assess core programming competencies and continuously adapts the learner’s roadmap using performance tracking, intelligent feedback, and AI-driven recommendations.
